# tsp_GA
This repository explores solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), one of the most well-known NP-hard problems in combinatorial optimization. As part of the learning process for object-oriented programming in Python, custom classes were designed to implement the key components of a Genetic Algorithm (GA), including initialization, selection, crossover, and mutation operators. All operators are coded manually to deepen understanding of both algorithmic design and class-based programming structures.

In addition to the evolutionary approach, this project aims to extend into machine learning-based methods. Specifically, future work will focus on investigating Pointer Networks, a neural network architecture capable of solving combinatorial optimization problems like TSP by learning the structure of optimal tours from data. Through this progression, the repository seeks to bridge classical algorithmic techniques and modern deep learning approaches for combinatorial optimization.

# About Genetic Algorithm
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a population-based metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. It iteratively evolves a set of candidate solutions toward better solutions by applying genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation. In each generation, individuals with higher fitness are more likely to contribute their genes to the next generation, promoting the exploration and exploitation of the solution space.
GA is widely used for solving complex optimization problems where traditional methods are inefficient or inapplicable, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
